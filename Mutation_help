Mutation pattern Help
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. The pattern should either start with '*' (for deletion) or '^' (for insertion). For substitution no special characters are required.
2. The second character should be an integer, that is the position in the peptide which has to be deleted, inserted, or substituted.
3. The third character should be '-'.
4. The fourth character should be the residue (amino acid single letter code).
5. Multiple patterns can be given, in that case each patten should be separted by ';'.
6. Example to delete residue at position 5. Pattern: 
	*5-x;
7. Example to insert residue A at position 9. Pattern: 
	^9-A;
8. Example to substitute residue T at position 11. Pattern: 
	11-T;
9. Example for multiple pattern. Pattern: 
	5-Y;*4-x;^7-P;
10. Add "-x to include the result of the given input as such without mutation. Example: 
	5-Y;"-x; 
	will generate output for substitution of Y at position 5 as well as for the given input as such.
