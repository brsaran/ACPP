If multiple sequence option is opted, only a maximum of 100 peptides are allowed per job.

If protein scan is opted, the maximum length of the input protein should not exceed 2000.

Results are self descriptive. When the treshold is set to 0.5, the SVM score close to 1 is considered as anticancer peptides, while close to 0 it is considered as non-anticancer peptides. (Refer article for details).
