# ACPP
Anti Cancer Peptide Predictor

ACPP is a Support Vector Machine based tool to predict whether the given peptide is an Anti-cancer peptide or Not. The three different modes include (i) Protein scan with apoptotic domain prediction; (ii) Multiple peptide mode; and (iii) Peptide mutation mode for prediction and design of anti-cancer peptides.
